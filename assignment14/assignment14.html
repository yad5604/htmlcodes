        <p>The Indian Army is the land-based branch and the largest component of the Indian Armed Forces. The President of India is the
           Supreme Commander of the Indian Army, and its professional head is the Chief of Army Staff (COAS), who is a four-star
            general. Two officers have been conferred with the rank of field marshal, a five-star rank, which is a ceremonial position
            of great honour.

        <div class="div"><p class="solid"></p></div>
        <p>In 1776, a Military Department was created within the government of the East India Company at Kolkata. Its main function was 
            to record orders that were issued to the army by various departments of the East India Company for the territories under its 
            control. With the Charter Act of 1833, the Secretariat of the government of the East India Company was reorganised into four 
            departments, including a Military Department. The army in the presidencies of Bengal, Bombay and Madras functioned as 
            respective Presidency Armies until 1 April 1895, when they were unified into a single Indian Army. For administrative 
            convenience, it was divided in to four commands, namely Punjab (including the North West Frontier), Bengal, Madras 
            (including Burma), and Bombay (including Sind, Quetta and Aden).</p>
